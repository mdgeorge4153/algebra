 - use classes?
 - ensure that pqueue test / arbitrary operation list produces large queues
 - enhance traits so that types are included; add property tests to ensure types of functions
 - add jasmine dependencies to tests properly
 - finish euclidean domain stuff
 - avoid duplicate tests
 - make sure arbitrary integer returns large things
 - improve parsing and pretty printing
 - perhaps unify vector, scalar, matrix into tensor
 - tests for non-general functions in mat2 and vec2
 - tests for well-definedness (if eq(a,b) then eq(f(a), f(b)))
 - decentralize tests
